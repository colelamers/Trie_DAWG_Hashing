This application shows implementations of Trie and Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG)'s using four separate forms of hashing systems.

1. Standard Hashing (with Java HashMaps)
2. Custom Hashing (but traditional HashMap)
3. Perfect Hashing
4. Cuckoo Hashing

Using all of these forms of hashing, I implement Tries and DAWGs to showcase their usefulness as a data structure.
